## Some examples

- Feedback loops
Feedback loops can occur when your model is controlling the next round of data you get. The data that is returned quickly becomes flawed by the software itself.
- When system is implimented with no way to identify & address mistakes

### 1. What is disinformation?

- Disinformation is more than just "fake news"
    - It includes memes, videos, social media posts, not only news.
    - It includes rumors, hoaxes, propaganda, misleading content and context. There are different motivations to create disinformation.
    - most of them are "misleading", not fake
    - "fake news" is coopted and used to attacke press nowadays
    - ex. The black feminist...: tried to make feminist look bad
- Disinformation includes orchestrated campaings of manipulation
    - it's not only the single post
    - ex. "Radio Africa", which is controlled by Russia. They have 73 fb pages. Stories about sports and culture. 
- Disinformation is ecosystem
    - most of people tweeting this was sincere people but the cited news are questionable sources
    - "the trumplet of amplicfication"
        - 4chan/8chan -> closed messaging group whatsapp etc -> consipiracy groups on reddit/ youtube -> social media -> professional media & politics
    - so many companies, cites are involved and therefore it is incosistent, difficult to address the issue
- Disinformaion undermines democracy
    - campaings of manipulation
- Disinformation pollutes our information environment
    - problem of disinformatio is not the post is not true but we may not believe things that are true
    - censorship now works by flooding with information so that you can't tell what's going on
    - Hack-and-Leak
        - narrative laundering; taking real document to create narrative
            - documentary films are cut and edited to tell a specifc story so there should be an ethical way to create it.
            - over-simplification of something converted to one tweet
            - phsycology papers generalized very specific experiment 
        - mix faceked document in with real documents

### 2. The tech platforms incentivte and promote disinformation
- platforms could be 
    - their design & architecture
        -  people share the content regardless with the credeblity. If they share or not connect with their political ties
        - by encorage users to rapidly scroll and spontaneous enage
        - mixes real news and emotinal posts
        - immediate quantified feedback (# of likes)
        - but when ask people to check creadibilty, they care a bit more about credibility
    - their recommendation system
        - The metric is gamed. Ex. Russian Muller report
    - their business models
        - online environments are designed to be addictive 
        - the incentives focus on short-term metrics
        - the fundamenal business model is around manipulating people's behavior & monopolizing their time
    - social and cultural dynamics
        - it's more than algorithm. YouTube influencers tell "do not believe media" and tell alt-rights 
- humans evolved as social being, to have our opinions influenced by other in our group
    https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
- online discussion will be swamped with fake, manipulative agents
    -  combination of fake photo and fake profile 
- extreme viewpoints can be normalized when we think we are around others who hold those views


### 4. What sould we do?
- Goal of disinformation
    - to disorient us and weaken our trust in institutions
    - ex. Pinterest changed the policy that only the truested institutions can make medical images and pins
- approaches
    - detecting fake/disinformation
    - responsible development tools
    - address the ecosystem
        - personalised ad target + disinformation -> no one else knows. So target more larger group so that at leaset there is someone detects it is misinfo
        - having ad dataset so that we can know all the ad happening on the platform. governance.
    - treat as cybersecurity issue
        - 
    - verification tools
